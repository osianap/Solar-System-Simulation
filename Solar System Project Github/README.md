A project I have developed for a university course. It is essentially a simulation of the inner planets using the Beeman numerical integration scheme with Newtonian physics.

To run the project you will need FFMPEG installed on your device and accessible from your IED. A simple way to do this is to download and install FFMPEG on your device, and then copy ffmpeg.exe into the project folder. This is found at https://ffmpeg.org/download.html
